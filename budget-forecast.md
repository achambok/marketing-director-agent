# Budget & Forecast Model (Outline)

- Allocation: 70% proven, 20% scale tests, 10% new bets
- Guardrails: CAC < LTV/3; Payback < 12 months; MER > 3 (examples)
- Monthly view: Spend → Leads → MQLs → SQLs → Opps → Pipeline → Revenue
- Scenarios: Base/Bull/Bear with levers (CVR, CPC, AOV, Win rate)
- Reallocation rule: Shift 10–20% monthly from bottom quartile to top quartile channels
